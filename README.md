# Node.js README Generator

## Description

I have developed a simple node.js application that takes user inputs via Inquierer and generates a professional README file with a working table of contents as well as useage, installation and other sections.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation

To install, copy the index.js, package.json and utils/ directory to a folder. Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies and the package is ready for use.

## Usage

To use the application, run 'node index.js' in the root folder and follow the propts. A README file will be written to the root directory.

See screenshot below to see the applicaiton running in terminal:
